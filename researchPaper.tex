\chapter{Introduction}

\newpage

Today's mobile platforms are designed to be mobile desktop computing
environments.  This means that they are optimized for local operations and not
for long run times.  The researcher believes this is out of step with the
current trends in Cloud Computing.  Just like in the beginnings of public
computing, Cloud Computing centralizes on the idea of making software available
as a service accessed over cheap or rented hardware.  The problems faced by the
original software providers (public access to the Internet and the cost of
providing and procuring the hardware) are not faced by today's service
providers, though.  Broadband Internet connectivity is widespread at this point,
at least in the developed and increasingly so in the developing world and
hardware has dropped in price enough that most families are able to afford it,
even in it's hybridized state.  The problem remains that truly widespread mobile
platform adoption is yet to happen.  The researcher believes that this is due to
the failing of mobile platform providers to captilize on the performance gains
possible in the dependence upon cloud computing resources which offload much of
the processing power required to do computation to a foreign machine and thus
extend battery life greatly through demand management.

The purpose of my research was to discover how the advent of cloud computing
will affect the design of mobile hardware.  Current mobile hardware is designed
with the idea of making a desktop computer mobile.  The emphasis is on local
computational power with applications and services that are hosted on your
machine.  The advent of Cloud Computing could allow for a redesign of mobile
platforms that focused on providing long battery life and high quality
connection to and use of cloud services.

The goal of the design would be to 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item Maximize battery life;
\item Maximize performance, perhaps through the design of a special processor
  that focusses on doing computation specific to utilizing web services
  efficiently; and
\item Minimize local computation to 
  \begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
  \item displaying the UI;
  \item translating input; and
  \item maintaining network connectivity.
  \end{inparaenum}
\end{inparaenum}

% Case for why the question is important or interesting and why the reader should want an answer?

The reason my research question is relevant is that cloud services are finally
beginning to gain real traction in the public's eye.  Many people are happy to
get their e-mail primarily through a web interface like GMail or Hotmail,
signaling a real change in public perceptions of performance, customizabliity,
and privacy.  Services like Google's Office Suite Google Docs, while still in
need of performance improvements, still perfectly serve for smaller
spreadsheets, documents, and presentations.  And they can be used on any
platform with access to a browser with exactly the same performance
characteristics as on the most performant machines today.  This reality allows
for the design of a truly cloud based mobile platform.
