\section{Research Questions}

The author's primary area of investigation was in hardware requirements of Cloud
Services.  Ultra-mobile PCs currently in the market have not, of yet, been
optimized for Cloud Service usage which makes them practically smaller, less
powerful, and cheaper Notebooks rather than a category of mobile hardware unto
themselves.  Currently, the best ultra-mobile PC battery life is 14
hours\footnote{Retrieved January 31, 2010 from
  \url{http://www.netbookreviews.net/asus/eee-pc-1005pe-review/}} from the Eee
PC 1005PE made by Netbook specialists ASUS; not a full day's worth of power even
under the best circumstances.  Most Netbooks ship with Hard Disk Drives which
consume more power than newer Solid State Drives.  They also run the same OSes
as their Notebook and Desktop cousins which are designed to operate a machine
that is processing everything locally.  By design, these computers miss the
opportunity to take advantage of Cloud Services by failing to implement a
hardware redesign that focuses on providing solid access to Cloud Services via
a platform with a laptop-like form factor but much higher battery life.  Doing
so could have Netbooks rival smart phones regarding life expectancy and
usability.  This is significant as the author believes that one of the primary
ways Netbooks could be improved through the use of Cloud Services is by
improving their battery life through demand management.

%% look like?  If it is indeed true that consumers still prefer traditional PCs
%% over Netbooks and Smart-Phones, what would get people to switch to more of a
%% mobile platform?  Would it be longer battery life?  Higher density screens?
%% Better software performance?  Would it matter if that performance was offered
%% via that cloud or would it have to be local?  These questions are especially
%% pertinent to the intended outcome of the research project.  The author intends
%% to create a paper prototype of a mobile platform that is ideal to meet average
%% consumer needs.

A second research question is whether or not Netbooks and traditional Notebook
PCs are comparable in the use of cloud services while they are unfavorably
comparable in their performance for traditional desktop usage.  In other words,
when using a cloud service, Notebooks and Netbooks will be just as performant,
while doing the same operations locally will produce a marked difference in
performance.
