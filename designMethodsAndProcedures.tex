\section{Design: Methods and Procedures}

This section outlines the different areas of knowledge that a reader of this
paper will need to be familiar with in order to be able to successfully
interpret the research presented.

The author assumes the reader has knowledge of:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item various aspects of hardware performance, especially those associated with
  inter-charge mobile life expectancy;
\item Cloud Services and how they are used;
\item the offerings available currently in today's mobile
  computing environment.
\end{inparaenum}

The problem that this research project is addressing focuses on the fact that
current adoption of ultra-mobile PCs has primarily been driven by price rather
than mobile performance \citep{ap2009}.  Wider spread adoption by customers
looking to have a device that is optimized for portability and long battery life
rather than just customers that are looking for a cheaper Notebook hasn't been
seen yet.  The author believes that the reason for this is that mobile platform
providers are still designing their machines to primarily behave as a stripped
down desktop.  As such, they do not optimize for use of Cloud Services in such a
way that their device will experience longer battery life and better performance
in that context.  The problem, then, is discovering what factors would have to
coincide to produce an ideal mobile platform for the public consumer.

The research questions being addressed are as follows:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
  \item The author's main hypothesis is that today's ultra-mobile PCs are not
    designed to take full advantage of Cloud Services and thus loose a potential
    performance gain in the name of behaving like Notebooks.  Tightly integrated
    here is the question: What would the ideal public consumer mobile platform,
    designed to take full advantage of cloud services, look like?
  \item A corollary hypothesis is that Netbooks and Notebooks perform nearly
    indistinguishably from each other when utilizing cloud services despite the
    observable differences in performance when using local applications.
\end{inparaenum}

The procedure that the researcher pursued for this project was split into 2 areas
of investigation:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item ways that battery life can be maximized through demand management; and
\item netbook/notebook performance comparability.
\end{inparaenum}

The author investigated research that has already been done in the area of
battery life performance.  It is common knowledge that a bright display, WiFi,
and Bluetooth are the biggest killers of battery life.  The author surveyed
research in the Demand Management field to find evidence for those claims.

The primary strategy for investigating Netbook vs. Notebook performance was
testing performance for services offered both locally and in the cloud.  This
was executed by testing spreadsheet operations on Google Docs and doing the same
operations locally.  Time to complete various tasks associated with the
spreadsheet was measured.  Based on this performance research, the author
constructed a theoretical computer that is optimized for the use of these
services in order to gain other performance boosts.

\subsection{Instrumentation}

%What do you need to do your project.  Only a couple paragraphs.

Equipment needed to reconduct my study would be
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item A MacBook;
\item An acer ASPIRE one;
\item Several Browsers;
\item OpenOffice.org;
\item The testing Spreadsheet.\footnote{Spreadsheet published here:
  \url{j.mp/cmscu498GSs}}
\item A Google account with access to Google Docs for spreadsheet analysis.
\item A clock or stopwatch to measure performance\footnote{The researcher used
  iChrono found here: \url{http://widgets.tossen.net/}}.
\end{inparaenum}

The MacBook needs the specifications outlined in Table~\ref{macbookSpecs} on
page~\pageref{macbookSpecs} with the software listed in
Table~\ref{macbookSoftware} on page~\pageref{macbookSoftware} installed.

The acer ASPIRE one needs the specifications outlined in Table~\ref{aspireSpecs}

\subsection{Procedure/Methodology}

%Expected recipe

The steps taken by the researcher to test performance of Netbooks and Notebook
using Google Docs Spreadsheet and its locally hosted counterpart OpenOffice.org
Calc were the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a source CSV file with ~3,000 random numbers between -1 and 1.
\item Create a new spreadsheet based on the CSV file.
\item Create a new column and fill with the function =An*10+1 where n is the
  current row.
\item Create a new column and fill with the function =MEDIAN(B1:Bn) where n is
  the current row.
\item Create a new column and enter 1-100 in the first hundred rows.
\item Create a new column and fill with the function =Dn/100 where n is the
  current row.
\item Create a new column and fill with the function =PERCENTILE(C1:C10004,En)
  where n is the current row.
\item Change an A column cell.
\end{enumerate}

The researcher used a Groovy script with the argument .25 to generate the random
numbers used to seed the functions of the spreadsheet.  For source
see Listing~\ref{randomSourceGen.groovy} in Appendix~\ref{sourceCode}.

\subsection{Delimitations}

%Suggestions for future research?

Generalization would be difficult because only Intel Core Duo and Atom
processors were being tested.  Also, a single broadband Internet connection was
used to conduct the testing so speed differences have not been fully explored.
Different office suites such as Microsoft Office and iWork offer different
performance characteristics and only one has been explored.  However, none of
these considerations should overly affect the ability to generalize.  Most of
today's mobile machines use processors with very similar performance
characteristics and office suites also are becoming indistinguishable.

It is impossible to prove the generalization of this research because there was
not enough time or resources to truly test on varied hardware and over various
connection.  That being said, there is no reason why the outcomes of the testing
would vary too widely across multiple mobile platforms.  Also, performance
testing was somewhat arbitrary as actual process sampling could not be
accomplished.  Instead, observation alone was used in conjunction with the
system monitoring applications of the respective operating systems.

Limitations in the Google Docs platform constrained the size of the testing
spreadsheet greatly.  A different service could be used to get a more realistic
baseline for cloud versus local performance comparison.

Only two platforms, a single browser, and a single office suite were tested on,
albeit across multiple platforms.  More hardware and software configurations
could be tested to help validate the generalization of the research conclusions.

\subsection{Results}

On the MacBook in Google Chrome, creation of the spreadsheet from the source
file took an average of 6 seconds based on ten trial uploads on the MacBook in
Google Chrome. Creation of the second column took an average of 3 seconds. The
third column took significantly longer, averaging 25 seconds. Data can be found
in Table~\ref{mbChromePerf} on page~\pageref{mbChromePerf}.

\input{table.mbChromePerf.tex}

The problem seemed to be filling the formula down on the entire column.  Google
Spreadsheet appears to be unable to handle large column selections without
freezing.  The researcher was unable to ascertain why this would be.  No CPU
usage of note was observed and no network traffic to speak of.  On occasion
after half an hour or so the page would refresh and the data would be there, but
more often than not it simply would never show up.

Creating the 3 columns needed to calculate percentiles was uninteresting.  Each
task averaged less than 1 second over 10 runs.

As was expected, performance was extremely comparable on the ASPIRE one when
using Chrome. See Table~\ref{aspChrPerf} on page~\pageref{aspChrPerf}.

\input{table.aspChrPerf.tex}

Creating the 3 columns needed to calculate percentiles remained uninteresting.

As an aside: while no significant difference at all was observed between the
two platforms' ability to compute the calculations demanded by the spreadsheet,
significant differences were observed in the performance associated with
changing the display of the data.  It appears that Google offloads most of the
data into memory and relies on local calculations to redisplay the data in the
window.  With the weaker CPU and Memory set, the Netbook saw performance losses
due to that.

At the sampling size Google Docs could handle before becoming unusable, creating
each of the columns of the Spreadsheet was instantaneous \emph{on both
  platforms}.  This was very surprising to the researcher although in retrospect
it should not have been.  At that sample size, no local spreadsheet system has
issues.  The researcher obtained a much larger spreadsheet\footnote{A testing
  spreadsheet for use with OpenOffice.org bug 89976
  \url{http://j.mp/cmscu498OOoSs}} which allowed a much closer comparison of the
two platforms and as expected the netbook performed far worse than the notebook;
actually an \emph{order of magnitude} worse. See Table~\ref{ooCp} on
page~\pageref{ooCp}.

\input{table.ooCp.tex}

These results are not very arbitrary but they are purely based on observation
which means that future researchers will come up with slightly different
results.  The results are demonstrated for verification by the tables of
performance data included in this text

Based on the above performance data, the following specifications are believed
to be an ideal mobile computer designed to maximize battery life and performance
when accessing the cloud.

The processor could be inexpensive and weak as during the utilization of the
Google Docs Spreadsheet neither machine's CPU usage went above 5\% during
calculations.  By intentionally downgrading the CPU, load on the battery would
be reduced.  This could be reduced even further by the addition of a specialized
GPU that was optimized for the display of web graphics would help the overall
performance as the biggest hit on the processor was during the redisplay of
data.

For storage, a small flash card or SIM chip could be used in place of
traditional hard disks.  This would be used to store the browser and minimal OS
needed to utilize the Cloud Service and would minimize the need to spin up, spin
down, and otherwise manage a physical disk.  No disk access was required during
the running of the performance tests, but utilizing Hibernate between sessions
would be much less battery intensive with the ability to simply write the
contents of memory to a flash disk.

Maintaining a small screen size for the mobile device helps greatly with the
battery expectancy but a higher density screen would be desirable.  This way
higher complexity web applications could be utilized comfortably without
sacrificing battery performance.  Another option would be to implement in
hardware the ability to zoom out and in.  This way low density screens could be
used which would boost battery performance slightly without sacrificing
usability.

A specialized OS and Browser could be developed for this system.  While doing
nothing on both machines the OS alone consumed 1--2\% of available CPU power.
Reducing that to 0 would help with battery life and increase the responsiveness
of the various web applications being utilized.
