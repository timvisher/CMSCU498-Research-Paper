%% From questions and hypotheses

Given time, the author would have tried to consider in detail what about current
mobile offerings is dissatisfying to the average consumer.  Despite enormous
inroads into mobile PC sales made by Netbook manufacturers like ASUS and Acer,
the primary drive for these PCs seems to be cost at this
point\citep{gladstone09}.  There is a dearth of research regarding actual
customer perception of mobile platforms designed for use in conjunction with
cloud services.  Customer surveying could be utilized to answer this question
and then utilized to aid in the mockup of the mobile platform.

Another area of future research could be investigating whether considerations
surrounding privacy affect peoples' opinion of cloud services at this point or
whether most people are comfortable with a corporation housing and protecting
their private data.  The author imagined that most people who grew up on the
Internet would have a lack of a sense of privacy and so would not mind giving
that data away to be held by someone else that they have no direct control over.
This would seem to be born out by the heavy use of services like Facebook to
store much of our private information.  The author also expected the answers to
this question to be stratified across generations, with the older generations
being more likely to not trust a service with any of their data.

%% From design methods and procedures

In regards to performance testing, the following areas of expansion are easily
seen.  Initially a much larger spreadsheet was desired but performance limits in
Google Docs forbid this.  Unfortunately, that made comparison at the local level
effectively moot as neither platform showed any difficulty at all in performing
the various calculations while much larger samples (~65,000) would take
significant time to open and just as much time to recalculate if things were
changed.  However, both systems had to be operating on the same data both
locally and in the cloud.  A different service would have to be discovered that
offered the ability to perform large scale spreadsheet calculations although the
researcher is unable to find any that offer better support for large
spreadsheets than Google Spreadsheets.
