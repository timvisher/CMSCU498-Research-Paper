  Lithium-Ion Batteries currently dominate the market of mobile power solutions
  for 2 main reasons:
  \begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
  \item Because of their physical structure, they are incredibly flexible in
    shape; and
  \item They do not suffer from issues of overcharging and charge memory that
    plagued traditional Nickel based rechargeable batteries.
  \end{inparaenum}.

  Despite it's obvious popularity, Lithium-Ion technology does have some
  disadvantages, namely:
  \begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
  \item A properly cared for Li-Ion battery will loose capacity at a strict and
    unavoidable rate, no matter what is done.
  \item Unless a breakthrough is made in the physical structure using
    nano-technology, battery capacity has plateaued.
  \end{inparaenum}

  The future of battery technology seems to lie in the direction of
  nano-technology research.  By utilizing nano-technology, the surface area over
  which the chemical reaction needed to produce power can take place is greatly
  increased and this much higher capacity is reached.  This technology has not
  been proven out yet.}
